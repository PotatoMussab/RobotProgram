# Description 
This program was made as a 3rd year Bachelor's project. The project task was to make a robot and the following program is the GUI. The GUI was to be displayed on a
Raspberry Pi screen mounted on the robot's head.
Some functionality will be missing since there are some signals to be sent between the face and various motors and sensors. Also there is no exit function
since the program is intended to continuously run
